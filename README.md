# ATLAS-iOS-Fall-22

App Idea:

Experience/benefit exploration app for veterans (VA.gov meets Airbnb)

Features/Organization (bottom nav):
  home screen- shows suggestions based on location/similar saved experiences
  search screen- allows user to filter by location, category (shopping, healthcare, education, experience)- highlights small businesses
  "saved" screen- shows experiences that have been favorited, allowing user to create folders for themselves
  
 Integrations:
  Assets library- posting reviews with photos
  Core locations
  Pushkit? (new offers in area?)
  
App should also give business owners/users ability to recommend new benefits that should be included.
