# ATLAS-iOS-Fall-22

App Idea:

Build an app for a local restaurant from my hometown in Washington that needs to a little modernization. Ferino's Pizzeria in Port Hadlock

Features:
  Menu- will require importing images
  Specials- should be easy to update
  Ordering on the app- would need a backend where the restaurant is getting the orders... if this is too much work, can have a beta version that at least
  shows restaurant's information for calling to place an order.
  
Organization (bottom nav):
  home screen- shows specials/seasonal items, restaurant info
  menu screen
  order screen
  account screen- ability to see past order
  
 Integrations:
  Apple pay?
  In-app purchase
  push notifications
